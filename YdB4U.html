        <p class="sour-gummy-regular">
            A football question
        </p>
        <p class="sour-gummy-regular">
            In the entire history of the two teams, Real Madrid and Barcelona has played each other two times on your birthday. 
            The first time was in 2007. Even though Messi was in Barcelona by this point, he didn't play this match and it ended a 1-0 
            win for Real Madrid. Neither of us were following football at that point either.
        </p>
        <p class="sour-gummy-regular">    
            The second match was well within the time we were following football, and this game ended quite differently. Barca won it 3-0, and both Messi and Suarez scored goals. 
            Do you remember which year this match was?

        <p class="sour-gummy-regular">
            Happy birthday, Safwana! Even though Hisham tried so hard to keep your name a secret, I still found out â€” guess he 
            underestimated me! ðŸ˜„ I honestly can't wait to meet you in person someday. Talking over the phone makes me a little 
            nervous, as you probably already know by now. But you're such a wonderful person, and I'd love the chance to connect 
            face-to-face. Wishing you an amazing day filled with love, joy, and all the happiness you deserve!
